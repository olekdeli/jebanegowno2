What to do if i want to have a one course, but two groups? (Like a class of International Law, but taught on two seperate occasions)

    Courses in this program are interpreted as one instance of a course. 
    This means that if two teachers (Mr. A and Mr. B) teach a course with 
    the same name (International law), but at (not necessarily) different 
    times, and with (not necessarily) different names, then in the 
    interpretation of the program they are teaching two different "courses".
    This does not mean that there is no way to indicate that it is the same 
    subject, taught in two different environments. There are also "groups" 
    in the program that help to combine instances of courses into larger 
    structures. Each group has its own name and a series of courses assigned 
    to it. Thanks to this, by adding the group "International law" and then 
    adding to this group the courses of Mr. A and Mr. B we can clearly 
    indicate that this is one school subject, taught on two different occasions.

Is there a history about u3a activities kept?
    Each course, once completed, is added to the list of completed courses,
    and its students move the course from the list of active courses to the 
    completed ones. Students cannot be enrolled or unenrolled in a completed course.
    Moreover, any action that changes the system state is saved as a "log" and 
    can be displayed via option no. 12




An explanation to the main interface of the programme:

1.Add a new (student/teacher/course)

    The basic function of the program. Allows you to add a student, teacher or course.

2.(Enroll/Deroll) a student into/from a course

    This function allows you to add or remove a student from a course. 
    Information about the courses you have attended is saved in both 
    the course object (student list) and the student object (courses).

3.Check (student/teacher/course) list

    Allows you to check the list of ALL student/teacher/course objects added to the system

4.Check student's courses

    Using "courses" list in the student object prints all the courses the student is part of

5.Print details about a (student/teacher/course)

    Prints all necessary information about the selected object

6.Delete a (student/teacher/course)

    Completely removes the object from the system. Not recommended for 
    many operations, because this option also removes all traces of the object in history. 
    To remove a student from a course, I suggest using the "deroll" option.

7.Connect courses as the same subject/group, but differenet instance of the group

    Allows forming groups of courses. These are structures that 
    combine many courses into named "groups". This allows you 
    to create single classes that have many extensions.

8.(Add/Remove) a lecturer (to/from) a course

    Allows you to add or remove a teacher as a class instructor. 
    One class can be taught by any number of instructors, however,
    if the course has no instructor, its status will change to "incomplete"

9.Print student list of a course

    Prints a list of students who are participating in the course

10.Add a timetable and a classroom to an instance of a course

    Allows you to add a classroom that has a default empty schedule
    from 8:00 to 20:00 Monday through Friday. The user can modify
    the schedule, add classes, check the availability of the room, 
    or check classes taking place at a specific time. It is also 
    possible to clear the schedule (or only few hours) when plans change.
    The system allows you to specify hours with an accuracy of 15 minutes
    

11.Mark a course as finished

    Designates the course as completed. Completed courses 
    cannot be modified, are not displayed in the set of active 
    courses, but are moved to the set of completed courses

12.Check logs(history)

    Rvery action that affects the state of affairs 
    of the system is recorded and stored under this option
